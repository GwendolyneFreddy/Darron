(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving throw: Special

This spell is an advanced version of the spell "Dimensional Chest". Basically, the spell functions similarly, but incorporates a planar guard to watch over the casket on its location between the planes, preventing it from being looted and inspected by creatures native to that plane.

When casting the spell, it will invoke the Keeper of the Chest, which describes the contents of the mage's Chest. The interior of this chest is virtually devoid of substance, and can store as many items you like.

The Guardian is linked to the will of the mage, but will struggle while in the Prime Material Plane, only planar creatures will fight to try to open the chest. However, if attacked in the short term remain with the mage, will defend itself by attacking her attacker and dispelling any magic. If destroyed, it recomposes beside the chest on another level, because its essence is tied to it and will only be effectively destroyed when the box is destroyed. Another reason that forces it to guard the treasure chest.~

This chest is made of more valuable materials, but their power is that it is capable of storing a large number of objects. The chest, being interplanar resides in a location away from any theft.

The mage can call to your side the Guardian up to twice a day to enter and remove objects from inside at will.~
@153 = ~Guardian~
